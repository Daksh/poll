Lesson 3: Collect Poll Data 

1) Now that your poll is built, invite people to take your poll on the XO. Walk around with your laptop, and ask people to answer your research question.  

2) Decide how you are going to get the information you need.  You could read your question and the answer choices to each person and click their answer on your XO. Or, you can show each person how to select your poll from the list, read the poll by themselves and click on their answer choice by themselves.  

3) For best results, each person shouldvote only once. The Poll will close when you reach the number of your “sample size.”  

4) Try to collect votes from the people you originally thought about when you chose the “number of votes to collect.” If it was girls, ask only girls.  Otherwise your results will not reflect the group you had in mind.

5) Remember, you can create the same poll again, and ask different kinds of people to answer each time.  It will be very interesting to compare the results of the same question asked to different groups, such as boys and girls or adults and children.
