Lesson 4: Use Data to make Observations and Decisions

1) After you have collected the poll data you needed from one or more groups, look at the results and think about what they mean.

2) Open the Poll Builder activity on your XO and find your poll title on the list. Click the “See Results” button to see how people voted.

3) Look at theBar Graphs that represent the votes (results) of your poll. 
Which answer has the longest bar? What does that mean? Which answer has the shortest bar? What does that mean?

4) If you tried your poll with different groups (girls, boys, teachers, students, adults, children, etc.) Open each poll and see if there are any differences.

5) Write down notes about what you see; put your findings on paper or record them with the “Write” activity on your XO. How does this kind of information help you draw conclusions about the people you surveyed? Does the data accurately represent an entire group?   Does it matter if you questioned 25 people or 100 people? Why?

6) Present you findings to your class, or to the people who took the poll. Tell them what you learned for the poll and discuss the results together. Brainstorm about what could be done with this information.
